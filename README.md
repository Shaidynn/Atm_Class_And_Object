I jumped into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and created something really cool: a virtual ATM machine.

Imagine we're building a new kind of ATM together. We'll use code to create this ATM, and I'll explain how I did it using simple terms.

First, we start by setting up our tools. We use a special box called "Scanner" to talk to our new ATM. It's like giving our ATM a way to understand what we want.

Next, we create our very own ATM. We name it "Shah's ATM" and give it a special color, which is white. We also give it a number: 14. This is like giving our ATM a unique identity. It's like calling it "ATM Number 14." And, of course, we name it after its owner, Kenil Shah (me).

Now, we want to welcome people when they use our ATM. So, we make the ATM say a friendly message. It tells you its name (Shah's ATM), its number (ATM Number 14), and even describes its color (white).

Our ATM can do more than just talk. It can help you deposit or withdraw money. And that's how it works. It understands what you say and does the right thing. It checks if you're sure about depositing or withdrawing. If you say "No," it understands that you changed your mind. If you say "Yes," it asks you how much money you want to deposit or withdraw.

But, it can handle misunderstandings too. If you say something strange, like "I want to fly to the moon," it won't get confused. It will politely say, "Sorry, I didn't understand. Please try again later."

Now, let me show you the secret behind all this. I created a special code to make our ATM so smart. It's like a recipe that tells the ATM what to do. I made a "class" called "ATM" that holds all the special information about our ATM.

The "class" is like a blueprint. It knows the color, the number, and the owner's name. And when we want to talk to our ATM, we use this blueprint to create a real, talking ATM!
